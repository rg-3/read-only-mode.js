## <a id='introduction'>Introduction</a>

read-only-mode.js is a browser extension that enables a read-only mode 
on the Twitter website where you cannot author tweets or replies.

## What's the idea behind this extension ?

This browser extension intends to make you think twice before authoring a 
tweet or reply and to boost your productivity by encouraging you to 
listen more than you talk (or read more than you write). I've found the 
extension helps me to get the most out of Twitter, and maybe it can help 
you too.
